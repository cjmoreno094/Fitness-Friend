# Get started by tracking fitness activities: a tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to download the API files and try one of the service actions: viewing all of the orca sightings reported in the app for the San Juan Islands. If you already [set up your development environment](set-up-dev-env.md), the process should take about 15 minutes.

## Step 1: Make sure you have the API files

The directory contains the following files:

*  `fitness-tracking-db.json`: a JSON file containing examples of activities and how to track.
*  `fitness-tracking.sh`: a shell script that starts JSON Server. Use this for Linux or macOS.
*  `fitness-tracking.bat`: a batch file that starts JSON Server. Use this for Windows.

## Step 2: Start JSON Server

*Info to come*

## Step 3: Use cURL or Postman to submit a request

```json
cURL data here
```

*Postman info here*
